# CSGMan

CSGMan is a 3D Game-development tool, designed for simple realtime CSG. 

Inspired by Realtime-CSG for Unity, this is a tool being designed for any Engine regardless of format,
with a current special emphasis on Godot. You might ask why Godot? Doesn't it support it natively?
It does, but currently it does not support more complex CSG features like UV editing. 
This is what I am designing the tool for, serious Level-design applications for potentially final geometry for a level.
Especially for Quake-like games.
